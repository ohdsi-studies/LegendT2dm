  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a serious
              complication. Large claims databases can potentially identify the
              effects that medications have on VTE. The purpose of this study
              is to evaluate the evidence supporting the validity of VTE codes.
              METHODS: A search of MEDLINE database is supplemented by manual
              searches of bibliographies of key relevant articles. We selected
              all studies in which a claim code was validated against a medical
              record. We reported the positive predictive value (PPV) for the
              VTE claim compared to the medical record. RESULTS: Our search
              strategy yielded 345 studies, of which only 19 met our
              eligibility criteria. All of the studies reported on ICD-9 codes,
              but only two studies reported on pharmacy codes, and one study
              reported on procedure codes. The highest PPV (65\%-95\%) was
              reported for the combined use of ICD-9 codes 415 (pulmonary
              embolism), 451, and 453 (deep vein thrombosis) as a VTE event. If
              a specific event like DVT (PPV 24\%-92\%) or PE (PPV 31\%-97\%)
              was evaluated, the PPV was lower than when the combined events
              were examined. Studies that included patients after orthopedic
              surgery reported the highest PPV (96\%-100\%). CONCLUSIONS: The
              use of ICD-9 415, 451, and 453 are appropriate for the
              identification of VTE in claims databases. The codes performed
              best when codes were evaluated in patients at higher risk of VTE.",

              physician review and adjudication of medical records for
              identifying venous thromboembolism (VTE), and to assess VTE
              incidence, recurrence, and mortality in a large national cohort
              of post-menopausal women followed up to 19years. MATERIALS AND
              METHODS: We used detailed clinical data from the Women's Health
              Initiative (WHI) linked to Medicare claims. Agreement between
              data sources was evaluated among 16,003 women during 1993-2010. A
              claims-based definition was selected to analyze VTE occurrence
              and impact among 71,267 women during 1993-2012. RESULTS: Our VTE
              definition had 83\% sensitivity. Positive predictive value was
              69\% when all records were included, and 94\% after limiting
              Medicare records to those with a WHI hospitalization adjudicated.
              Annualized VTE incidence was 4.06/1000person-years (PY),
              recurrence was 5.30/100PY, and both rates varied by
              race/ethnicity. Post-VTE mortality within 1year was 22.49\% from
              all causes, including 1.01\% from pulmonary embolism, 10.40\%
              from cancer, and 11.08\% from other causes. Cancer-related VTE
              compared to non-cancer VTE had significantly (p<0.001) higher
              recurrence (9.86/100PY vs. 4.43/100PY) and mortality from all
              causes (45.89\% vs. 12.28\%), but not from pulmonary embolism
              (0.40\% vs. 1.27\%). CONCLUSIONS: Medicare claims compared
              reasonably well to physician adjudication. The combined data
              sources provided new insights about VTE burden and prognosis in
              older women.",

              candidates for outpatient treatment or abbreviated hospital stay.
              There is a need for a claims-based prediction rule that
              payers/hospitals can use to risk stratify PE patients. We sought
              to validate the In-hospital Mortality for PulmonAry embolism
              using Claims daTa (IMPACT) prediction rule for in-hospital and
              30-day outcomes. METHODS: We used the Optum Research Database
              from 1/2008-3/2015 and included adults hospitalized for PE
              (415.1x in the primary position or secondary position when
              accompanied by a primary code for a PE complication) and having
              continuous medical and prescription coverage for >/=6-months
              prior and 3-months post-inclusion or until death. In-hospital and
              30-day mortality and 30-day complications (recurrent venous
              thromboembolism, rehospitalization or death) were assessed and
              prognostic accuracies of IMPACT with 95 \% confidence intervals
              (CIs) were calculated. RESULTS: In total, 47,531 PE patients were
              included. In-hospital and 30-day mortality occurred in 7.9 and
              9.4 \% of patients and 20.8 \% experienced any complication
              within 30-days. Of the 19.5 \% of patients classified as low-risk
              by IMPACT, 2.0 \% died in-hospital, resulting in a sensitivity
              and specificity of 95.2 \% (95 \% CI, 94.4-95.8) and 20.7 \% (95
              \% CI, 20.4-21.1). Only 1 additional low-risk patient died within
              30-days of admission and 12.2 \% experienced a complication,
              translating into a sensitivity and specificity of 95.9 \% (95 \%
              CI, 95.3-96.5) and 21.1 \% (95 \% CI, 20.7-21.5) for mortality
              and 88.5 \% (95 \% CI, 87.9-89.2) and 21.6 \% (95 \% CI,
              21.2-22.0) for any complication. CONCLUSION: IMPACT had
              acceptable sensitivity for predicting in-hospital and 30-day
              mortality or complications and may be valuable for retrospective
              risk stratification of PE patients.",

              physician claims associated with an inpatient stay). Average
              symptom onset was 1.5 days prior to hospital admission (range: 19
              days prior to 4 days after admission).PPVs for principal and
              secondary VTE discharge diagnoses were similar to prior study

              researchers will not have access to death information in the
              enrollment files. We developed and evaluated a claims-based
              definition of death. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used
              healthcare claims and enrollment data between January 2005 and
              August 2009 for 195,193 beneficiaries aged 20 to 74 in 3 private
              health insurance unions. We developed claims-based definitions of
              death using discharge or disease status and Charlson comorbidity
              index (CCI). We calculated sensitivity, specificity and positive
              predictive values (PPVs) using the enrollment data as a gold
              standard in the overall population and subgroups divided by
              demographic and other factors. We also assessed bias and
              precision in two example studies where an outcome was death. The
              definition based on the combination of discharge/disease status
              and CCI provided moderate sensitivity (around 60\%) and high
              specificity (99.99\%) and high PPVs (94.8\%). In most subgroups,
              sensitivity of the preferred definition was also around 60\% but
              varied from 28 to 91\%. In an example study comparing death rates
              between two anticancer drug classes, the claims-based definition
              provided valid and precise hazard ratios (HRs). In another
              example study comparing two classes of anti-depressants, the HR
              with the claims-based definition was biased and had lower
              precision than that with the gold standard definition.
              CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The claims-based definitions of death
              developed in this study had high specificity and PPVs while
              sensitivity was around 60\%. The definitions will be useful in
              future studies when used with attention to the possible
              fluctuation of sensitivity in some subpopulations.",

  abstract = "AIMS: Type 2 diabetes is common and is associated with an
              approximate 80\% increase in the rate of mortality. Management
              decisions may be assisted by an estimate of the patient's
              absolute risk of adverse outcomes, including death. This study
              aimed to derive a predictive risk model for all-cause mortality
              in type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We used primary care data from a
              large national multi-ethnic cohort of patients with type 2
              diabetes in New Zealand and linked mortality records to develop a
              predictive risk model for 5-year risk of mortality. We then
              validated this model using information from a separate cohort of
              patients with type 2 diabetes. RESULTS: 26,864 people were
              included in the development cohort with a median follow up time
              of 9.1 years. We developed three models initially using
              demographic information and then progressively more clinical
              detail. The final model, which also included markers of renal
              disease, proved to give best prediction of all-cause mortality
              with a C-statistic of 0.80 in the development cohort and 0.79 in
              the validation cohort (7610 people) and was well calibrated.
              Ethnicity was a major factor with hazard ratios of 1.37 for
              indigenous Maori, 0.41 for East Asian and 0.55 for Indo Asian
              compared with European (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We have developed
              a model using information usually available in primary care that
              provides good assessment of patient's risk of death. Results are
              similar to models previously published from smaller cohorts in
              other countries and apply to a wider range of patient ethnic

              increased hyperkalemia risks in heart failure patients receiving
              aldosterone blockers in addition to standard therapy. The aim of
              this study is to assess the hyperkalemia risk and combined use of
              spironolactone and long-term ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme)
              inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy for heart
              failure in a real-life setting of a heterogeneous population.
              METHODS: Using claims data of the statutory health insurance fund
              AOK, covering 30\% of the German population, we performed a
              nested case-control study in a cohort of heart failure patients
              receiving continuous ACE/ARB therapy (n = 1,491,894).
              Hyperkalemia risk associated with concurrent use of
              spironolactone and ACE/ARB was calculated by conditional logistic
              regression in 1062 cases and 10,620 risk-set-sampling-matched
              controls. RESULTS: Risk of hyperkalemia in heart failure patients
              was significantly associated with spironolactone use (odds ratio
              (OR) (95\% confidence interval (CI)) = 13.59 (11.63-15.88) in all
              and 11.05 (8.67-14.08) in those with information on New York
              Heart Association (NYHA) stage of disease). In the NYHA
              subpopulation, higher risk estimates were observed in short-term
              as compared with long-term users (OR (95\%CI) = 13.00
              (9.82-17.21) and 9.12 (6.78-12.26), respectively). Moreover, the
              association was stronger in older (>/=70 years of age) as
              compared with younger patients (<70 years of age) (OR (95\%CI) =
              12.32 (9.35-16.23) and 8.73 (5.05-15.08), respectively), although
              interaction was not significant (pinteraction = 0.07).
              CONCLUSIONS: Hyperkalemia risk associated with combined use of
              spironolactone and ACE/ARB is much stronger in real-life practice
              than observed in clinical trials. Careful potassium level

              of hyperkalemia using a large US commercial claims database.
              METHODS: Adults with serum potassium lab data (2010 to 2014) and
              >/=1 calendar year of data were included from a large US
              commercial claims database. Hyperkalemia was defined as >/=2
              serum potassium measurements >5.0 mEq/L or one hyperkalemia
              diagnosis code (ICD-9-CM, 276.7) or one sodium polystyrene
              sulfonate fill. Hyperkalemia prevalence was estimated for the
              overall population and subgroups with hyperkalemia-related
              comorbidities by calendar year. Hyperkalemia prevalence was also
              standardized to the US population to estimate the number of US
              adults with hyperkalemia. RESULTS: The analysis included
              2,270,635 patients (2010-2014). The annual prevalence of
              hyperkalemia in the overall population was 1.57\% in 2014, with
              higher rates observed in patients with chronic kidney disease
              (CKD), heart failure, diabetes and hypertension. Among patients
              with CKD and/or heart failure, the 2014 annual prevalence was
              6.35\%. Among patients with hyperkalemia, 48.43\% had CKD and/or
              heart failure in 2014. The prevalence of hyperkalemia was higher
              in patients with more severe CKD, as well as older patients and
              men. Extrapolating those results to the US population supports
              that 1.55\% or 3.7 million US adults had hyperkalemia in 2014.
              CONCLUSIONS: An estimated 3.7 million US adults had hyperkalemia
              in 2014, and this prevalence rate has increased since 2010. In
              patients with CKD and/or heart failure, the annual prevalence of
              hyperkalemia was 6.35\% in 2014, and about half of all patients

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Hyperkalemia (serum potassium >5.0 mEq/L) may be
              caused by reduced kidney function and drugs affecting the
              renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and is often present in
              patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). OBJECTIVE: To
              quantify the burden of hyperkalemia in US Medicare
              fee-for-service and commercially insured populations using
              real-world claims data, focusing on prevalence, comorbidities,
              mortality, medical utilization, and cost. METHODS: A descriptive,
              retrospective claims data analysis was performed on patients with
              hyperkalemia using the 2014 Medicare 5\% sample and the 2014
              Truven Health Analytics MarketScan Commercial Claims and
              Encounter databases. The starting study samples required patient
              insurance eligibility during >/=1 months in 2014. The
              identification of hyperkalemia and other comorbidities required
              having >/=1 qualifying claims in 2014 with an appropriate
              International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision,
              Clinical Modification diagnosis code in any position. To address
              the differences between patients with and without hyperkalemia,
              CKD subsamples were analyzed separately. Mortality rates were
              calculated in the Medicare sample population only. The claims
              were grouped into major service categories; the allowed costs
              reflected all costs incurred by each cohort divided by the total
              number of member months for that cohort. RESULTS: The prevalence
              of hyperkalemia in the Medicare and commercially insured samples
              was 2.3\% and 0.09\%, respectively. Hyperkalemia was associated
              with multiple comorbidities, most notably CKD. The prevalence of
              CKD in the Medicare and the commercially insured members with
              hyperkalemia was 64.8\% and 31.8\%, respectively. After adjusting
              for CKD severity, the annual mortality rate for Medicare patients
              with CKD and hyperkalemia was 24.9\% versus 10.4\% in patients
              with CKD without hyperkalemia. The allowed costs in patients with
              CKD and hyperkalemia in the Medicare and commercially insured
              cohorts were more than twice those in patients with CKD without
              hyperkalemia. Inpatient care accounted for >50\% of costs in
              patients with CKD and hyperkalemia. CONCLUSION: Hyperkalemia is
              associated with substantial clinical and economic burden among US
              commercially insured and Medicare populations.",
